    content: `
      <p>The landscape of automation is changing. Traditional RPA (Robotic Process Automation) was about following rules. <strong>Agentic AI</strong> is about setting goals.</p>
      <h3>What is Agentic AI?</h3>
      <p>Unlike chatbots that wait for a prompt, AI agents can proactively plan, use tools, and execute multi-step workflows to achieve an objective. For example, an agent could autonomously monitor your supply chain, identify a delay, and re-route a shipment—only asking for human approval if the cost exceeds a certain threshold.</p>
      <h3>The Business Case</h3>
      <p>Companies deploying agentic workflows are seeing:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Processes that took days now take minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> Reduction in human error for repetitive tasks.</li>
        <li><strong>Innovation:</strong> Employees are freed up to focus on strategic initiatives.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>At OpenQuest Solutions, we specialize in building custom AI agents tailored to your specific business needs.</p>

      <p>Multi-cloud is the new normal. But with great flexibility comes great complexity. Managing different security protocols, billing models, and APIs can be a nightmare.</p>
      <h3>Key Challenges</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Data Silos:</strong> Fragmented data across providers.</li>
        <li><strong>Security Gaps:</strong> Inconsistent policies leading to vulnerabilities.</li>
        <li><strong>Cost Spirals:</strong> Unused resources accumulating bills.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Our Approach</h3>
      <p>We recommend a unified control plane strategy. By abstracting the infrastructure layer, you can enforce policy-as-code across all your environments.</p>

      <p>Did you know that inefficient code consumes more electricity? By optimizing algorithms and reducing data transfer, we can significantly lower energy consumption.</p>
      <h3>Cloud Optimization</h3>
      <p>Moving to the cloud isn't automatically green. It requires selecting carbon-neutral regions and right-sizing instances to avoid waste.</p>
